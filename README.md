# Apartment App
This app has been created for you to mimic the feeling of entering into a developer role where there is established code that you have not created. This Apartment application has a few features that have been created for you and some key items that have been left totally untouched. Part of your job as a developer is to be able to pick up code that has already been created, understand what is going on with it, and continue the development of that code. 

## üë®‚Äçüíª How We Got Here
```
$ rails new apartment-app -d postgresql -T
$ cd apartment-app

$ bundle add react-rails
$ rails webpacker:install
$ rails webpacker:install:react
$ yarn add @babel/preset-react
$ yarn add @rails/activestorage
$ yarn add @rails/ujs
$ rails generate react:install
$ rails generate react:component App
$ bundle add devise
$ rails generate devise:install

```

## üõ† Configurations

### Devise Config
**config/environments/development.rb**
```ruby
This line added:
config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }
```

**config/initializers/devise.rb**
```ruby
# This line replaced:
config.sign_out_via = :delete
# With this line:
config.sign_out_via = :get
```

File added in app/views/home called index.html.erb
**app/views/home/index.html.erb**
```javascript
<%= react_component 'App', {
  logged_in: user_signed_in?,
  current_user: current_user,
  new_user_route: new_user_registration_path,
  sign_in_route: new_user_session_path,
  sign_out_route: destroy_user_session_path
} %>
```

### React in Rails Config

**app/views/layouts/application.html.erb**
```ruby
# This line replaced:
<%= javascript_importmap_tags %>
# With this line:
<%= javascript_pack_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %>
```

**config/routes.rb**
```ruby
# These lines added:
get '*path', to: 'home#index', constraints: ->(request){ request.format.html? }
root 'home#index'
```

### React Routing Config
```bash
yarn add react-router-dom@5.3.0
```

**app/javascript/components/App.js**
```javascript
import {
  BrowserRouter as  Router,
  Route,
  Switch
} from 'react-router-dom'
```

### Reactstrap Config
```bash
bundle add bootstrap
mv app/assets/stylesheets/application.css app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss
yarn add reactstrap
```

**app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss**
```css
@import 'bootstrap';
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Getting Started ‚àö
Once you're able to clone the repository, within the root of the project directory, run:

```bash
bundle 
yarn
rails db:setup
```

## üèÅ Start the App ‚àö
```bash
rails s
```

See what is available already in the application.
- What can a USER do? Currently a user can sign in/sign up/ log out/ see all pages
- What views (pages, components) are available?
header, footer, index, edit, show, new, home, notfound

## üè° Apartment Resource ‚àö
The Devise User model is going to have an association with the Apartment model. In this situation, the User will have many apartments and the Apartments will belong to a User.

```bash
rails generate resource Apartment street:string city:string state:string manager:string email:string price:string bedrooms:integer bathrooms:integer pets:string image:text user_id:integer
rails db:migrate
```

### User and Apartment Associations
The Apartments will belong to a User and a User will have many apartments.

**app/models/apartment.rb**
```ruby
class Apartment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
end
```

**app/models/user.rb**
```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # Include default devise modules. Others available are:
  # :confirmable, :lockable, :timeoutable, :trackable and :omniauthable
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
         :recoverable, :rememberable, :validatable
  has_many :apartments
end
```

## üöó Testing
To run the existing testing suite, run:

```bash
yarn jest
rspec spec/
```

### Apartment Data Specs
Tests you will need are:  

REQUEST: 
- to ensure a user can see all apartments
- to ensure a user can see all apartments that belong to them
- to ensure a user can make a new apartment
- to ensure a user can update an apartment
- to ensure a user can remove an apartment
- to ensure a user cannot make a new apartment with nil values
- to ensure an error will be thrown if an unregistered user tried to make an apartment
- to ensure an error will be thrown if a user tries to edit an apartment that doesn't belong to them
- to ensure an error will be thrown if a user tries to delete an apartment that doesn't belong to them

MODELS: 
- to ensure apartment is valid
- to ensure a user cannot make a new apartment with nil values
- to ensure a user cannot make a new apartment that already exists in the database
- to ensure a user cannot update an apartment with nil values
- to ensure a user cannot update another user's apartment

**The following code is a mock and does not work but is here to get your started.**
```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe "Apartments", type: :request do
  describe "GET /index" do
    it 'returns a list of apartments' do
    
      user = User.where(email: 'test@example.com').first_or_create(password: '12345678', password_confirmation: '12345678')

      user.apartments.create(
        street: string,
        city: string,
        state: string,
        manager: string,
        email: string, 
        price: string, 
        bedrooms: integer, 
        bathrooms: integer, 
        pets: string,
        image: text
      )

      get '/apartments'

      apartments = JSON.parse(response.body)
      expect(response).to have_http_status(200)
      expect(apartments.length).to eq(1)
    end
  end
end
```

## My Approach/Initial Notes
- This exercise allows you to perform the crucial point of development: problem solving
- Checkout the README
- Since this database is shared through http we have to run some type $ rails db:create, I chose $ rails db:prepare because it drops db, create, migrate, and seeds 
- All steps before Getting Started have been completed
- Begin at Getting Started
- Look at Trello
- To quickly refresh webpacker in an additional tab run: $ ./bin/webpack-dev-server
- Option + V will create a checkmark to areas that I completed

## Devise Views
app/views/devise
sessions
 - login form-group on all the divs with fields, each class get a form-control and placeholder. Take off label = sign
registrations
passwords


## 1) branch: environment ‚àö
> Modified the application.html.erb because it is a template of the app that every view/page will render

> It grabs every single page and yields it html

> partials used on this file will point to where the information lives

```ruby
#  app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
<title>TreeHouse</title>
  <body>
    HEADER HERE
    <%= yield %>
    FOOTER HERE
  </body>

#  create app/views/home/about.html.erb
<h1>About Us</h1>

#  app/controllers/home_controller.rb
  def index
  end
  
  def about
  end

#  config/routes.rb
    get 'home/about'

# - Use bootstrap for styling   https://getbootstrap.com/
# a blend of the template from bootstrap site and info already on application.html.erb
# https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/
# Tutorial codemy.com https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxNneOy8ewU&list=PLCC34OHNcOtrk3BDsfZwf4GattdLoKCOF&index=3

# bootstrap class that automatically gives spacing/alignment
    <div class="container">yield</div>

# Get header on all pages
#  Create a partial view...app/views/home/_header.html.erb
HEADER GOES HERE....
# - on application.html.erb...rails know to look for the file
    <%= render 'home/header' %>

# Go to components on bootstrap for navbar, add to header.html.erb 
# If the partial view was not created, then this code would have to live on the application.html.erb instead of having render 'home/header'
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark bg-dark">
  <div class="container-fluid">
    <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">TreeHouse</a>

# Modify links and remove items that will not be used
  <%= link_to 'TreeHouse App', root_path, class:"navbar-brand" %>

  <li class="nav-item">
    <%= link_to 'About Us', home_about_path, class:"nav-link" %>
  </li>
```

## 2) branch: rails-crud
- reference syllabus https://github.com/learn-academy-2022-charlie/Syllabus/blob/main/rails/generate-resource.md
- FORGOT to make associations as stated in stubbed README, ideally do this after generating resource
- since ran resource only need to create controller in rails and views will be handled by react pages/components using fetch requests
```ruby
# app/controllers/application_controller.rb
  skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token

# index method
  def index
    apartments = Apartment.all
    render json: apartments
  end

# rails c
# make sure logged in so you don't have to create a user
user1 = User.find 1
user1.apartments.create street: "Fake Street", city: "Fake City", state: "FS", manager: "Manny Fake", email: "fake.email.com", price: "$1000/day", bedrooms: 0, bathrooms: 0, pets: "imaginary", image: "https://live.staticflickr.com/1323/660567985_0588581de2_b.jpg"
