# Apartment App
This app has been created for you to mimic the feeling of entering into a developer role where there is established code that you have not created. This Apartment application has a few features that have been created for you and some key items that have been left totally untouched. Part of your job as a developer is to be able to pick up code that has already been created, understand what is going on with it, and continue the development of that code. 

## üë®‚Äçüíª How We Got Here
```
$ rails new apartment-app -d postgresql -T
$ cd apartment-app
$ rails db:create
$ bundle add rspec-rails
$ rails generate rspec:install
$ bundle add webpacker
$ bundle add react-rails
$ rails webpacker:install
$ rails webpacker:install:react
$ yarn add @babel/preset-react
$ yarn add @rails/activestorage
$ yarn add @rails/ujs
$ rails generate react:install
$ rails generate react:component App
$ bundle add devise
$ rails generate devise:install
$ rails generate devise User
$ rails db:migrate
$ rails generate controller Home
```

## üõ† Configurations

### Devise Config
**config/environments/development.rb**
```ruby
This line added:
config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }
```

**config/initializers/devise.rb**
```ruby
# This line replaced:
config.sign_out_via = :delete
# With this line:
config.sign_out_via = :get
```

File added in app/views/home called index.html.erb
**app/views/home/index.html.erb**
```javascript
<%= react_component 'App', {
  logged_in: user_signed_in?,
  current_user: current_user,
  new_user_route: new_user_registration_path,
  sign_in_route: new_user_session_path,
  sign_out_route: destroy_user_session_path
} %>
```

### React in Rails Config

**app/views/layouts/application.html.erb**
```ruby
# This line replaced:
<%= javascript_importmap_tags %>
# With this line:
<%= javascript_pack_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %>
```

**config/routes.rb**
```ruby
# These lines added:
get '*path', to: 'home#index', constraints: ->(request){ request.format.html? }
root 'home#index'
```

### React Routing Config
```bash
yarn add react-router-dom@5.3.0
```

**app/javascript/components/App.js**
```javascript
import {
  BrowserRouter as  Router,
  Route,
  Switch
} from 'react-router-dom'
```

### Reactstrap Config
```bash
bundle add bootstrap
mv app/assets/stylesheets/application.css app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss
yarn add reactstrap
```

**app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss**
```css
@import 'bootstrap';
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Getting Started ‚àö
Once you're able to clone the repository, within the root of the project directory, run:

```bash
bundle 
yarn
rails db:setup
```

## üèÅ Start the App ‚àö
```bash
rails s
```

See what is available already in the application.
- What can a USER do? Currently a user can sign in/sign up/ log out/ see all pages
- What views (pages, components) are available?
header, footer, index, edit, show, new, home, notfound

## üè° Apartment Resource ‚àö
The Devise User model is going to have an association with the Apartment model. In this situation, the User will have many apartments and the Apartments will belong to a User.

```bash
rails generate resource Apartment street:string city:string state:string manager:string email:string price:string bedrooms:integer bathrooms:integer pets:string image:text user_id:integer
rails db:migrate
```

### User and Apartment Associations
The Apartments will belong to a User and a User will have many apartments.

**app/models/apartment.rb**
```ruby
class Apartment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
end
```

**app/models/user.rb**
```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # Include default devise modules. Others available are:
  # :confirmable, :lockable, :timeoutable, :trackable and :omniauthable
  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
         :recoverable, :rememberable, :validatable
  has_many :apartments
end
```

## üöó Testing
To run the existing testing suite, run:

```bash
yarn jest
rspec spec/
```

### Apartment Data Specs
Tests you will need are:  

REQUEST: 
- to ensure a user can see all apartments
- to ensure a user can see all apartments that belong to them
- to ensure a user can make a new apartment
- to ensure a user can update an apartment
- to ensure a user can remove an apartment
- to ensure a user cannot make a new apartment with nil values
- to ensure an error will be thrown if an unregistered user tried to make an apartment
- to ensure an error will be thrown if a user tries to edit an apartment that doesn't belong to them
- to ensure an error will be thrown if a user tries to delete an apartment that doesn't belong to them

MODELS: 
- to ensure apartment is valid
- to ensure a user cannot make a new apartment with nil values
- to ensure a user cannot make a new apartment that already exists in the database
- to ensure a user cannot update an apartment with nil values
- to ensure a user cannot update another user's apartment

**The following code is a mock and does not work but is here to get your started.**
```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe "Apartments", type: :request do
  describe "GET /index" do
    it 'returns a list of apartments' do
    
      user = User.where(email: 'test@example.com').first_or_create(password: '12345678', password_confirmation: '12345678')

      user.apartments.create(
        street: string,
        city: string,
        state: string,
        manager: string,
        email: string, 
        price: string, 
        bedrooms: integer, 
        bathrooms: integer, 
        pets: string,
        image: text
      )

      get '/apartments'

      apartments = JSON.parse(response.body)
      expect(response).to have_http_status(200)
      expect(apartments.length).to eq(1)
    end
  end
end
```

## My Approach/Initial Notes
- This exercise allows you to perform the crucial point of development: problem solving
- Checkout the README
- Since this database is shared through http we have to run some type $ rails db:create, I chose $ rails db:prepare because it drops db, create, migrate, and seeds 
- All steps before Getting Started have been completed
- Begin at Getting Started
- Look at Trello
- To quickly refresh webpacker in an additional tab run: $ ./bin/webpack-dev-server
- Option + V will create a checkmark to areas that I completed

## Error Messages
```
Error: Cannot find module '../assets/treelogo.png'
    at webpackMissingModule (Footer.test.js:22:1)
    ReferenceError: App is not defined
    at eval (eval at ./node_modules/react_ujs/react_ujs/src/getConstructor/fromGlobal.js.module.exports
```
- Got that error after improper path to image
- ../../ to show the levels that needed to go to retrieve images in the javascript folder

## Loading images‚àö
- in javascript/assets
  - import treelogo from '../../../assets/treelogo.png'
  - <img src={treelogo} alt="Logo" height="35" width="auto"/>
- app/assets/images and referenced in views
  - <%= image_tag "treelogo.png", height: 50 %>
- application.scss
```css
body {
  background: image-url('lighter.png') repeat center fixed;
  background-size: cover;
} 
```

## 1) branch: environment ‚àö
> Modified the application.html.erb because it is a template of the app that every view/page will render

> It grabs every single page and yields it html

> partials used on this file will point to where the information lives

```ruby
#  app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
<title>TreeHouse</title>
  <body>
    HEADER HERE
    <%= yield %>
    FOOTER HERE
  </body>

#  create app/views/home/about.html.erb
<h1>About Us</h1>

#  app/controllers/home_controller.rb
  def index
  end
  
  def about
  end

#  config/routes.rb
    get 'home/about'

# - Use bootstrap for styling   https://getbootstrap.com/
# a blend of the template from bootstrap site and info already on application.html.erb
# https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/
# Tutorial codemy.com https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxNneOy8ewU&list=PLCC34OHNcOtrk3BDsfZwf4GattdLoKCOF&index=3

# bootstrap class that automatically gives spacing/alignment
    <div class="container">yield</div>

# Get header on all pages
#  Create a partial view...app/views/home/_header.html.erb
HEADER GOES HERE....
# - on application.html.erb...rails know to look for the file
    <%= render 'home/header' %>

# Go to components on bootstrap for navbar, add to header.html.erb 
# If the partial view was not created, then this code would have to live on the application.html.erb instead of having render 'home/header'
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark bg-dark">
  <div class="container-fluid">
    <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">TreeHouse</a>

# Modify links and remove items that will not be used
  <%= link_to 'TreeHouse App', root_path, class:"navbar-brand" %>

  <li class="nav-item">
    <%= link_to 'About Us', home_about_path, class:"nav-link" %>
  </li>
```

## 2) branch: rails-crud ‚àö
- reference syllabus https://github.com/learn-academy-2022-charlie/Syllabus/blob/main/rails/generate-resource.md
- FORGOT to make associations as stated in stubbed README, ideally do this after generating resource
- since ran resource only need to create controller in rails and views will be handled by react pages/components using fetch requests
```ruby
# app/controllers/application_controller.rb
  skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token

# index method
  def index
    apartments = Apartment.all
    render json: apartments
  end

# rails c
# make sure logged in so you don't have to create a user
user1 = User.find 1
user1.apartments.create street: "Fake Street", city: "Fake City", state: "FS", manager: "Manny Fake", email: "fake.email.com", price: "$1000/day", bedrooms: 0, bathrooms: 0, pets: "imaginary", image: "https://live.staticflickr.com/1323/660567985_0588581de2_b.jpg"

# Check browser
http://localhost:3000/apartments

# show method, create a show.html.erb on apartment view
  def show
    apartment = Apartment.find([params[:id]])
    render json: apartment
  end

# add a another entry
user1.apartments.create street: "Another Fake Street", city: "Another Fake City", state: "FS", manager: "Fanny Fake", email: "aint.email.com", price: "$1050/week", bedrooms: 2, bathrooms: 1, pets: "only air", image: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/View_from_Pagatpat_tree_house_-_panoramio_%281%29.jpg"

# Check browser

# create method
  def create
    apartment = Apartment.create(apartment_params)
    if apartment.valid?
      render json: apartment
    else
      render json: apartment.errors
    end
  end

  private
  def apartment_params
    params.require(:apartment).permit(:street, :city, :state, :manager, :email, :price, :bedrooms, :bathrooms, :pets, :image)
  end

# Postman error states {"user":["must exist"]}
POST http://localhost:3000/apartments

# Will modify devise user method, Need to review Wildlife Tracker project for research on devise user, all other endpoints work on Postman

# update method
  def update
    apartment = Apartment.find(params[:id])
    apartment.update(apartment_params)
    render json: apartment
  end

# destroy method
  def destroy
    apartment = Apartment.find(params[:id])
    apartment.destroy
    render json: apartment
  end

# testing in spec/models/apartment_spec.rb
  let(:user) { 
    User.create email: 'fake@email.com', password: '123456', password_confirmation: '123456' 
  }

    it 'should have a valid street' do
    apt = Apartment.create city: "Another Fake City", state: "FS", manager: "Fanny Fake", email: "aint.email.com", price: "$1050/week", bedrooms: 2, bathrooms: 1, pets: "only air", image: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/View_from_Pagatpat_tree_house_-_panoramio_%281%29.jpg", user_id: user.id
    expect(apt.errors[:street]).to include "can't be blank"
  end

# add notice and alert to application view
      <p class="notice"> <%= notice %> </p>
      <p class="alert"> <%= alert %> </p>
```

## 3) branch: devise ‚àö
```ruby
# conditional rendering in home view
<% if user_signed_in? %>
  <li class="nav-item">
    <%= link_to 'Sign Out', destroy_user_session_path, method: :delete, class:"nav-link" %>
  </li> 
  <li class="nav-item">
    <%= link_to 'Edit Profile', edit_user_registration_path, class:"nav-link" %>
  </li>
  <li class="nav-item">
  <%= link_to 'Tree Houses', apartments_path, class:"nav-link" %>

  </li>
  <li class="nav-item">
    <%= link_to 'Sign In', new_user_session_path, class:"nav-link" %>
  </li>
<% end %>
```
- $ rails g devise:views

- $ rails generate migration add_username_to_user
```ruby
# db/migrate
class AddUsernameToUser < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    # add_column :table, :column_name, :data_type
    add_column :users, :username, :string

  def configure_permitted_parameters
    # pass params for the sign up form
    devise_parameter_sanitizer.permit(:sign_up, keys: [:username, :email, :password])
    # pass params for the sign in form
    devise_parameter_sanitizer.permit(:account_update, keys: [:username, :email, :password])
  end
end

# config/initializers/devise.rb
# This line is commented out and set to false.
# config.scoped_views = false

# Update the value to be true:
config.scoped_views = true
```

- Go to app/views/devise/registrations/new.html.erb
- Go to app/views/devise/registrations/edit.html.erb
- Go to app/views/devise/sessions/new.html.erb: 
  - Add form-group on all the divs with field
  - Add class:"form-control", placeholder:"message"
  - For the check_box, add form-check and class:"form-control"
  - button, add class:'btn btn-secondary'

## 4) branch: mock-apt (read functionality)
- Add a file to javascript called mockApartments.js 
```javascript
let apartments = [
  {
    id: 1,
    street: "Another Fake Street", 
    city: "Another Fake City", 
    state: "FS",

    )
  })}   
      </>

  }
}

export default ApartmentIndex

```

## Routes
```ruby
# If you want a route to index or show pages to be rendered on a view, place path as a string 
<%= link_to 'Tree Houses', "/apartmentindex", class:"nav-button" %>
# if wanted auto links
<%= render "devise/shared/links" %>
```
```javascript
// example of a test
describe("When Home renders", () => {
  it("displays a heading", () => {
    const home = shallow(<Home />)
    const homeHeading = home.find("h3")
    console.log("HOME", homeHeading.debug());
    expect(homeHeading.text()).toEqual("Home from React")
  })
})
```

## Toggle button
Had to add bs to the toggle and target attributes

## Footer idea
```
