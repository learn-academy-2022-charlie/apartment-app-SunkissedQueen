  Lorem Khaled Ipsum is a major key to success. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile. Lion! The weather is amazing, walk with me through the pathway of more success. Take this journey with me, Lion! We the best. The other day the grass was brown, now it’s green because I ain’t give up. Never surrender. Surround yourself with angels, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel.

  Learning is cool, but knowing is better, and I know the key to success. You smart, you loyal, you a genius. Stay focused. Special cloth alert. A major key, never panic. Don’t panic, when it gets crazy and rough, don’t panic, stay calm. Major key, don’t fall for the trap, stay focused. It’s the ones closest to you that want to see you fail. The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key. The first of the month is coming, we have to get money, we have no choice. It cost money to eat and they don’t want you to eat.
